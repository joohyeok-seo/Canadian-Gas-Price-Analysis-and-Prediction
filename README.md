# Canadian-Gas-Price-Analysis-and-Prediction
A project analyzing Canadian gas prices, including statistical insights, regional trends, and predictive models like SARIMA and clustering for data-driven recommendations.

## 1. Basic Statistics

### Purpose
This notebook calculates fundamental statistics and visualizes the data distribution for gas prices across regions and fuel types.

### Key Features
1. **Data Loading**
   - Reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
   - Provides an overview of the dataset using summary statistics.

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Computes mean, median, variance, min, and max values for gas prices.
   - Splits data by fuel type and region to analyze trends.

3. **Visualizations**
   - **Histogram**: Displays the distribution of gas prices for each fuel type.
   - **Boxplot**: Compares gas price distributions across regions and fuel types.

### Key Insights
- The boxplot reveals notable price differences across regions for specific fuel types.
- Histogram shows clear clustering of prices around central tendencies for each fuel type.

### Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For visualizations.
